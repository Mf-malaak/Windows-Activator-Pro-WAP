# Windows-Activator-Pro-WAP

Activation Process Handling: The code uses various commands (slmgr.vbs) to activate Windows based on the selected version and edition.

UI Elements: It employs Tkinter widgets like labels, buttons, and comboboxes to create a user interface for selecting Windows versions and editions.

Debugger Check: There seems to be a debugger check implemented using ctypes.windll.kernel32.IsDebuggerPresent() to prevent debugging.

Functionality: The program can get Windows activation status, deactivate Windows, reset licensing status, and fetch Windows version and edition information.

About and Help Functions: It includes buttons that display information via message boxes for About and Help.

External Links: Lastly, there are links to websites associated with developers and teams displayed as clickable labels at the bottom.

While this code demonstrates the GUI for a Windows Activator, it's important to note that creating and distributing software to modify or activate operating systems can potentially raise legal and ethical concerns. Activation of software through methods not approved by the software provider can be illegal and can potentially cause security risks or violate terms of service.

If this is a personal project or for learning purposes, it's important to refrain from distributing or using such software outside the terms and conditions of the software provider. Also, ensure you are complying with laws and ethical guidelines while developing such applications.
